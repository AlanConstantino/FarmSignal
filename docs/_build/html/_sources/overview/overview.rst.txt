FarmSignal is an open-source, easy-to-use automated plant watering solution.

-------
Problem
-------

Most people do not have time to take care of their plants. Some water their plants too little, too much, or not at all which is a problem for the longevity of a plant’s life.
The ambient temperature and humidity of a room also play a role in a plant’s development. Enter FarmSignal, open-source and easy to use automated plant watering system that
addresses the problem of adequately watering your plant in a timely manner while also monitoring the ambient temperature and humidity of the room it is in.

----
Why?
----

Existing automated plant watering systems tend to be expensive, not user friendly, not feasible to assemble, or contain components that corrode away over continued use.
FarmSignal aims to address all the aforementioned issues while aiming to be affordable and accessible for anyone regardless of computer or programming experience.

----
How?
----

The FarmSignal system monitors the plant’s water intake with a soil moisture sensor and waters the plant accordingly using a water pump, a relay, and a Raspberry Pi while
at the same time monitoring the room’s ambient temperature and humidity. All of the data gathered from the Raspberry Pi is accessible to the user through the use of a web
application. The assembly and installation processof FarmSignal is accessible, affordable, and easy-to-follow for the end-user through the use of both text and video documentation.
